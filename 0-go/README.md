# Code Explanation for 0-go

```go
package main
```

Indicates that the code is part of the `main` package, which is the entry point for executables in Go.

```go
var index = `
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <body>
   <div id="counter">Counter: 0</div>

    <button>Add 1</button>

    <button>Reset!</button>

  </body>
</html>
`
```

Declares a variable named `index` and assigns it a string containing a HTML code snippet. The HTML represents a web page with a counter and two buttons.

```go
func main() {
 http.HandleFunc("/", handleIndex)

 log.Print("Listening on :8080...")
 http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

`http.HandleFunc("/", handleIndex)` registers a handler function `handleIndex` to be called when the root URL ("/") is accessed.

A handler function can contain any kind of logic, but must always take a `http.ResponseWriter` and a `http.Request` as its arguments. The `http.ResponseWriter` is used to write the response to the client. The `http.Request` contains information about the request, such as the URL and the request headers.

`log.Print("Listening on :8080...")` logs a message indicating that the server is listening on port 8080.

`http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)` starts a HTTP server listening on port 8080.

```go
func handleIndex(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
 w.Write([]byte(index))
}
```

`w.Write([]byte(index))` writes the contents of the `index` variable as the response to the client's request.

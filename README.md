# The 10.10.0 tech stack

This is a step-by-step walkthrough of the different technologies used in the 10.10.0 tech stack.

Each directory introduces a new technology, and contains a `README.md` file explaining how that technology works. Each step builds on the previous one, so we recommend going through them in order.

Each `README.md` file includes a `Quickstart` section at the top, which contains the commands needed to run the code in that directory. However, we recommend reading the file in full to understand how to set up and use the technology in your own codebase.
